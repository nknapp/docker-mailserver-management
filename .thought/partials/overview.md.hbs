This project is becoming a user-management-tool for the [docker-mailserver](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserves)
project.

First impressions can be drawn from the class [postfix-accounts.js](src/postfix-accounts.js) that is able to 
modify the `postfix-accounts.cf`-file from the docker-mailserver.

The final goal is to have an API and Web-Interface that can be exposed by users of `docker-mailserver` to let users
change that own password.
